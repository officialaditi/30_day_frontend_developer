ðŸ›‘ for_of_loop

The for...of loop is a modern and concise way to iterate over the elements of an array (or other iterable objects like strings, maps, sets, etc.).

 It allows you to access the elements directly without using an index.

 syntax:-

 for (let element of iterable) {
    // Code to execute for each element
}


=> iterable: The array (or other iterable object) you want to iterate over.
=> element: The variable that holds the value of the current element in each iteration.


example:-

let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
for (let element of arr) {
    console.log(element);
}

10
20
30
40
50

// using for character of string;

let str = "Hello";
for (let char of str) {
    console.log(char);
}
