ðŸ›‘ do_while_loop

The do...while loop is similar to a while loop, but with one key difference: 
=> it executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is false

=> This is because the condition is checked after the code block runs.

example:-

do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);

let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i); // Print the current value of i
    i++; // Increment i
} while (i <= 5); // Check the condition after executing the code block
