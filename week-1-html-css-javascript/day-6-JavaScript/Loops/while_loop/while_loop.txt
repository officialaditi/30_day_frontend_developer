ðŸ›‘ while loop

The while loop in JavaScript is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

tâ€™s a bit different from a for loop because it focuses on the condition and doesnâ€™t have a built-in initialization or increment mechanism.

syntax:-

while (condition) {
    // code to execute
}

example:-

let i = 1; // Start with 1
while (i <= 5) { // Keep looping while i is less than or equal to 5
    console.log(i); // Print the current value of i
    i++; // Increment i by 1 after each iteration
}
