❇️ for loop

=> A for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat a block of code.

syntax:-
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to execute
}

example:-
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number:", i);
}

explanation:-

==> let i = 1: Start the loop with i = 1.
==> i <= 5: Continue looping as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
==> i++: Increment i by 1 after each iteration.
