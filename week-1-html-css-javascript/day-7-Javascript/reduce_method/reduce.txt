ðŸ›‘ Reduce Method


==> the reduce method executes a reducer function for array elements.

==> the reduce method return a single value, that is the function's accumulated result.

==> the reduce method does not execute the function for empty array elements;

==> the reduce method does not change the original array.

syntax:-

array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr )){}

==> function() = Required.
                 A function to be run for each element in the array.

Reducer function parameters:
==> total =	Required.
            The initialValue, or the previously returned value of the function.
==> currentValue = Required.
                   The value of the current element.
==> currentIndex = Optional.
                   The index of the current element.
==> arr = Optional.
          The array the current element belongs to.

=> we have to provide the initial value, if there's no initial value it take first element of array as initial value for accumulator.
